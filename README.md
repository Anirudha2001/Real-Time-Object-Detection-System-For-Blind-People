# Real-Time-Object-Detection-System-For-Blind-People
In this project we developed real-time object detection system for blind individuals using YOLO algorithm, providing auditory feedback and enhancing spatial awareness. Improved independent navigation for visually impaired users.

# Voice Button:
The Voice Button lets you control the camera using voice commands. Say "start camera," and the application will begin capturing live images for object detection.

# Manual Button:
The Manual Button gives you direct control. Click it, and the camera starts capturing live images instantly, without needing voice commands.

# Help Button:
The Help Button provides information about how to use the application. It explains voice commands, manual controls, and other services offered by the object detection application.

# Exit Button:
The Exit Button allows you to close the application gracefully. Click it when you're done to stop any ongoing processes and exit the program smoothly.
